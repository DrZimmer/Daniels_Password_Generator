# Daniel Zimmermann's Password Generator

## Challenge 3 Description

Initial code was given for the creation of my own password generator.
Thanks to Qing (TA) and classmate Thom for their help with figuring out the flow of the functions as well as the random function.

- Series of prompts given to the user to ask them if they would like four types of characters or not.
- At least one type had to be chosen, and each answer given was validated with an alert.
- After choosing character types (input and validation passwordRequirements function), generate password function was started.
- Generate password function pushed and concated TRUE (chosen) characters into an empty array to be used for final password.
- Random function was used to generate final password as well as given code at the end to display that in the text box above the button.
